### How to install and use contents of GeoAR-B2C-Admin
*Inside GeoAR-B2C-Admin, you could find two subfolders which are MyLayers and MyEvents, they are my developed customised widgets of ArcGIS Experience Builder with ArcGIS API for Javascript and ReactJS, the steps we need to do are:*

*1. Download ArcGIS Experience Builder Developer Edition from Esri Official website: https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/* </br>
*2. Install ArcGIS Experience Builder Developer Edition on your machine following the full official steps: https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/guide/install-guide/* </br>
*3. Copy these two Folders under ($your_exb_root_folder)/client/your-extensions/widgets/* </br>
*4. Dir to ($your_exb_root_folder)/server/, and run ```npm start```; Again, Dir to ($your_exb_root_folder)/client/, and run ```npm start```* </br>
*5. Defaultly, the listenting port is 3001, so browse https://localhost:3001, login with your App ID and remote AGOL/Portal* (see step 2's link)*</br>
*6. Create a project or choose a template (see step 2's link), then on your left-hand side, you could see these two customised widgets are lying on the panel, then you could either drag or add these two customised widgets to your right-hand side content area to use them.* </br>
*7. Please pay attention that you also need to set the **Map Component** for both of the widgets on the right-hand side setting panel before you launch and run the app.* </br>
*8. When run and use the widgets, please make sure that use MyLayers Widget first and tick the Event_Layers before you use MyEvents Widget* </br>
